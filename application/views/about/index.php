						<p>The Painted Desk came to life after years of "upscaling" my own items to get a new look out of old furniture and decor. Rummage Sales, Pop-Up Markets, garage salse, and thrift stores have always excited me with all the potential</p>
						<p>I prefer to re-use and extend the life of quality built, sturdy furniture over buying cheap pressed board like materials from big box stores. It's my way recycling.</p>
						<p>I painted things over the years and had friends offer to by them if I ever decided to get rid or the pieces that I painted. When I realized the marktet for it, along with the fact that I truly enjoy the process &mdash; I turned it into a business.</p>
